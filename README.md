# Python-Learning
Hey guys, just starting out programming, specifically learning python, html and css at the same time.
So here in thi repository I will upload my mini-python programms, that I will write to learn the language. Probably not worth your time.
Always open for tipps and tricks =)
Anyway, just thought, that learning to work with GitHub is part of learning to programm, so I am uploading that "unimportant" stuff here - just to get use to it
